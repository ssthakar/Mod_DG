[1mNAME[0m[m
       script - make typescript of terminal session[m
[m
[1mSYNOPSIS[0m[m
       [1mscript[0m [options] [[4mfile[24m][m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mscript[0m makes a typescript of everything on your terminal session. The terminal data are stored in raw form to the log file and information about timing to another (optional) structured log file. The timing[m
       log file is necessary to replay the session later by [1mscriptreplay[0m(1) and to store additional information about the session.[m
[m
       Since version 2.35, [1mscript[0m supports multiple streams and allows the logging of input and output to separate files or all the one file. This version also supports new timing file which records additional[m
       information. The command [1mscriptreplay[0m [1m--summary[0m then provides all the information.[m
[m
       If the argument [4mfile[24m or option [1m--log-out[0m [4mfile[24m is given, [1mscript[0m saves the dialogue in this [4mfile[24m. If no filename is given, the dialogue is saved in the file [4mtypescript[24m.[m
[m
       Note that logging input using [1m--log-in[0m or [1m--log-io[0m may record security-sensitive information as the log file contains all terminal session input (e.g., passwords) independently of the terminal echo flag[m
       setting.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       Below, the [4msize[24m argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as[m
       "KiB"), or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.[m
[m
       [1m-a[0m, [1m--append[0m[m
           Append the output to [4mfile[24m or to [4mtypescript[24m, retaining the prior contents.[m
[m
       [1m-c[0m, [1m--command[0m [4mcommand[24m[m
           Run the [4mcommand[24m rather than an interactive shell. This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.[m
[m
       [1m-E[0m, [1m--echo[0m [4mwhen[24m[m
           This option controls the [1mECHO[0m flag for the slave end of the sessionâ€™s pseudoterminal. The supported modes are [4malways[24m, [4mnever[24m, or [4mauto[24m.[m
[m
           The default is [4mauto[24m â€” in this case, [1mECHO[0m enabled for the pseudoterminal slave; if the current standard input is a terminal, [1mECHO[0m is disabled for it to prevent double echo; if the current standard input[m
           is not a terminal (for example pipe: [1mecho[0m [1mdate[0m [1m|[0m [1mscript[0m) then keeping [1mECHO[0m enabled for the pseudoterminal slave enables the standard input data to be viewed on screen while being recorded to session log[m
           simultaneously.[m
[m
           Note that 'never' mode affects content of the session output log, because users input is not repeated on output.[m
[m
       [1m-e[0m, [1m--return[0m[m
           Return the exit status of the child process. Uses the same format as bash termination on signal termination (i.e., exit status is 128 + the signal number). The exit status of the child process is always[m
           stored in the type script file too.[m
[m
       [1m-f[0m, [1m--flush[0m[m
           Flush output after each write. This is nice for telecooperation: one person does [1mmkfifo[0m [1mfoo;[0m [1mscript[0m [1m-f[0m [1mfoo[0m, and another can supervise in real-time what is being done using [1mcat[0m [1mfoo[0m. Note that flush has[m
